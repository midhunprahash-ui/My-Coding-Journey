*(Last Updated: May 8, 2025)*

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my daily journey of tackling random LeetCode problems. My goal is to consistently improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and maintain a record of my progress.

## ðŸ“– About This Repository

As a student continuously exploring the vast field of software development, I use this repository to:

* **Track my daily coding habit:** Solving a LeetCode problem is part of my daily routine.
* **Reinforce learning:** Each problem is an opportunity to learn something new or solidify existing knowledge.
* **Showcase my skills:** This serves as a living portfolio of my problem-solving abilities in Python and Java.
* **Personal Reference:** A quick way for me to look back at solutions and approaches I've used.

## ðŸ“‚ How It's Organized

I tackle problems as they come, so the organization here reflects that. You'll typically find solutions organized by the **problem name (often including the LeetCode problem number for uniqueness)**.

I aim for a clear structure, usually like this:
/
â”œâ”€â”€ 001-Two-Sum/                 # Folder named with LeetCode number and problem name
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TwoSum.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TwoSum.java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Optional: My notes, approach, complexity for this specific problem
â”œâ”€â”€ 015-3Sum/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 3Sum.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Another-Problem-Name/      # If no LeetCode number, a descriptive name
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AnotherProblemName.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
